      <description>Specialist in Distributed Secure Systems  Currently I am currently working as IT Security Analyst at Verimi with significant contribution to the security of the digital identity offered by Verimi. Specifically, I am involved in security-, risk- &amp;amp; workflow-analyses as well as technology &amp;amp; architecture security (e.g. vulnerability scans, coordination of pentests). Verimi is unique worldwide and offers the chance of a secure digital identity and the sovereignty over his own data.</description>
