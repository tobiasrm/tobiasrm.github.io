      <description>Specialist in Distributed Secure Systems  Currently I am currently working as Head of IT Architecture for Verimi, contributing to the overall objective to give users back the control over their secure identity. Specifically, I am involved in IT/Cloud architecture decisions, security/risk assessments, technology evaluations and the continuous improvement of the tech-team. In my opinion, Verimi is worldwide unique and offers users the chance of a secure digital identity and sovereignty over their own data.</description>
